# ***Potato Disease Detection Using Deep Learning***

---

## ***Project Overview***

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based image classification model to detect diseases in potato plant leaves. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained to identify three classes: healthy, early blight, and late blight. This automated approach assists farmers and agricultural professionals by enabling early and accurate detection of plant diseases, improving crop management and reducing manual inspection effort.

## ***What the Project Covers***

* Image classification using CNNs: A convolutional neural network is built from scratch to recognize disease patterns in leaf images.
* Dataset usage: The dataset includes labeled images of potato leaves categorized as healthy, early blight, or late blight. It is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
* Data preprocessing and augmentation: Techniques such as rescaling, flipping, and rotation are applied to increase the model's generalization capability.
* Model training and evaluation: The model is developed and trained using TensorFlow and Keras, with performance assessed using accuracy and loss metrics.
* Visualization: Training history is plotted to understand the model's learning behavior over time.
